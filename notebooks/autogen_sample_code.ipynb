      "\n",
      "**Roles:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Engineer:** Skilled in coding and data manipulation.\n",
      "* **Scientist:** Knowledgeable about LLMs and their applications, able to interpret research papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **(Engineer)** **Collect Papers:** Write a script to automatically:\n",
      "    * Access the arXiv API.\n",
      "    * Query for papers submitted in the last week containing keywords like \"Large Language Model\", \"LLM\", \"Natural Language Processing\", \"Deep Learning\" in the title or abstract.\n",
      "    * Download the abstracts of the relevant papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **(Scientist)** **Identify Domains:** \n",
      "    * Read the downloaded abstracts.\n",
      "    * Categorize each paper based on its application domain (e.g., Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Robotics, Healthcare, etc.). \n",
      "    * Create a list of identified domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **(Engineer)** **Generate Markdown Table:**\n",
      "    * Develop a script that takes the list of domains and corresponding papers from the Scientist.\n",
      "    * Organizes the information into a markdown table with the following columns:\n",
      "        * **Domain:** The application domain of the LLM.\n",
      "        * **Paper Title:** The title of the research paper.\n",
      "        * **Link:** A hyperlink to the arXiv page of the paper.\n",

      "4. **(Both)** **Review and Refine:**\n",

      "**Iteration:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan is iterative. Feedback from the Admin and critic will be incorporated to improve the process and the final output. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Admin:** Might request additional columns in the table, like author names or publication date.\n",

      "## Critique of LLM Application Papers Summarization Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan is a good starting point, but it could benefit from some improvements in clarity, robustness, and verification:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Clear Roles:**  Well-defined roles for Engineer, Scientist, and Admin.\n",
      "* **Iterative Approach:**  Acknowledges the need for feedback and refinement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Areas for Improvement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Specificity in Keyword Search:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Problem:**  Keywords like \"Natural Language Processing\" and \"Deep Learning\" are very broad and might return many irrelevant papers. \n",
      "* **Solution:**  Use more specific keywords related to LLM applications, such as:\n",
      "    * \"Language Modeling\"\n",
      "    * \"Transformer Networks\"\n",
      "    * \"Text Generation\"\n",
      "    * \"Code Generation\"\n",
      "    * \"Few-shot Learning\"\n",
      "    * \"Prompt Engineering\"\n",
      "* **Additional Tip:** Consider using boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) in your search query to refine results further.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Domain Categorization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Problem:**  The plan relies solely on the Scientist to categorize papers, which can be subjective and prone to inconsistencies.\n",
      "* **Solution:**\n",
      "    * **Develop a Predefined Taxonomy:** Create a more structured list of potential LLM application domains beforehand. This will ensure consistency and make it easier to categorize papers.\n",
      "    * **Consider Multiple Labels:** Some papers might span multiple domains. Allow for assigning multiple domain labels to a single paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Verifiable Information (Source URL):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Problem:** The plan mentions adding a hyperlink to the arXiv page but doesn't explicitly state it as a requirement.\n",
      "* **Solution:**  Clearly state that the \"Link\" column in the markdown table **must** contain a working hyperlink to the arXiv page of each paper. This ensures verifiability and easy access to the source material.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Code Reusability and Automation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Problem:** The plan mentions separate scripts for collecting papers and generating the table. \n",
      "* **Solution:**  Design a single, modular script that can handle both tasks. This improves code reusability and makes future updates easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Error Handling and Edge Cases:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Problem:** The plan doesn't address potential errors (e.g., API connection issues, missing data in abstracts).\n",
      "* **Solution:**  Incorporate error handling mechanisms in the code to handle unexpected situations gracefully. For example:\n",
      "    * Implement retries for failed API requests.\n",
      "    * Log any papers that couldn't be categorized due to missing or unclear information in the abstract.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Revised Plan Suggestion (Incorporating Feedback):**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Define Domain Taxonomy:** Collaboratively (Engineer, Scientist) define a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM application domains.\n",
      "2. **Develop Script:** Engineer develops a script to:\n",
      "    * Query arXiv API using refined keywords and boolean operators.\n",
      "    * Download abstracts and extract relevant metadata (title, authors, date, URL).\n",
      "    * Provide an option to categorize papers based on the predefined taxonomy (potentially with multiple labels).\n",
      "    * Generate a markdown table with columns: Domain(s), Title, Authors, Date, Link (hyperlink to arXiv page).\n",
      "    * Include error handling and logging.\n",
      "3. **Initial Run and Review:** Run the script, and both Engineer and Scientist review the output for accuracy and completeness.\n",
      "4. **Refinement and Iteration:**  Refine the script, keywords, or taxonomy based on the review. Repeat steps 3-4 until satisfactory results are achieved.\n",
      "5. **Admin Approval:** Submit the final markdown table and code to the Admin for approval. \n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these points, you can create a more robust, verifiable, and efficient plan for summarizing LLM application papers from arXiv. \n",

Feedback from the Admin and critic will be incorporated to improve the process and the final output. For example:\\n\\n* **Admin:** Might request additional columns in the table, like author names or publication date.\\n* **Critic:** Might suggest more specific keywords for the arXiv search or a more nuanced categorization of domains. \\n\\nThe Engineer and Scientist will collaborate to address the feedback and refine the plan accordingly until it receives Admin approval. \\n', 'name': 'Planner', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '## Critique of LLM Application Papers Summarization Plan\\n\\nThis plan is a good starting point, but it could benefit from some improvements in clarity, robustness, and verification:\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n* **Clear Roles:**  Well-defined roles for Engineer, Scientist, and Admin.\\n* **Iterative Approach:**  Acknowledges the need for feedback and refinement.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n\\n**1. Specificity in Keyword Search:**\\n\\n* **Problem:**  Keywords like \"Natural Language Processing\" and \"Deep Learning\" are very broad and might return many irrelevant papers. \\n* **Solution:**  Use more specific keywords related to LLM applications, such as:\\n    * \"Language Modeling\"\\n    * \"Transformer Networks\"\\n    * \"Text Generation\"\\n    * \"Code Generation\"\\n    * \"Few-shot Learning\"\\n    * \"Prompt Engineering\"\\n* **Additional Tip:** Consider using boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) in your search query to refine results further.\\n\\n**2. Domain Categorization:**\\n\\n* **Problem:**  The plan relies solely on the Scientist to categorize papers, which can be subjective and prone to inconsistencies.\\n* **Solution:**\\n    * **Develop a Predefined Taxonomy:** Create a more structured list of potential LLM application domains beforehand. This will ensure consistency and make it easier to categorize papers.\\n    * **Consider Multiple Labels:** Some papers might span multiple domains. Allow for assigning multiple domain labels to a single paper.\\n\\n**3. Verifiable Information (Source URL):**\\n\\n* **Problem:** The plan mentions adding a hyperlink to the arXiv page but doesn\\'t explicitly state it as a requirement.\\n* **Solution:**  Clearly state that the \"Link\" column in the markdown table **must** contain a working hyperlink to the arXiv page of each paper. This ensures verifiability and easy access to the source material.\\n\\n**4. Code Reusability and Automation:**\\n\\n* **Problem:** The plan mentions separate scripts for collecting papers and generating the table. \\n* **Solution:**  Design a single, modular script that can handle both tasks. This improves code reusability and makes future updates easier.\\n\\n**5. Error Handling and Edge Cases:**\\n\\n* **Problem:** The plan doesn\\'t address potential errors (e.g., API connection issues, missing data in abstracts).\\n* **Solution:**  Incorporate error handling mechanisms in the code to handle unexpected situations gracefully. For example:\\n    * Implement retries for failed API requests.\\n    * Log any papers that couldn\\'t be categorized due to missing or unclear information in the abstract.\\n\\n**Revised Plan Suggestion (Incorporating Feedback):**\\n\\n1. **Define Domain Taxonomy:** Collaboratively (Engineer, Scientist) define a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM application domains.\\n2. **Develop Script:** Engineer develops a script to:\\n    * Query arXiv API using refined keywords and boolean operators.\\n    * Download abstracts and extract relevant metadata (title, authors, date, URL).\\n    * Provide an option to categorize papers based on the predefined taxonomy (potentially with multiple labels).\\n    * Generate a markdown table with columns: Domain(s), Title, Authors, Date, Link (hyperlink to arXiv page).\\n    * Include error handling and logging.\\n3. **Initial Run and Review:** Run the script, and both Engineer and Scientist review the output for accuracy and completeness.\\n4. **Refinement and Iteration:**  Refine the script, keywords, or taxonomy based on the review. Repeat steps 3-4 until satisfactory results are achieved.\\n5. **Admin Approval:** Submit the final markdown table and code to the Admin for approval. \\n\\nBy addressing these points, you can create a more robust, verifiable, and efficient plan for summarizing LLM application papers from arXiv. \\n', 'name': 'Critic', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '```python\\n#!/usr/bin/env python\\nimport arxiv\\nimport datetime\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\n# Define search parameters\\nsearch_query = \\'ti:\"Large Language Model\" OR ti:\"LLM\" OR abs:\"Language Modeling\" OR abs:\"Transformer Networks\" OR abs:\"Text Generation\" OR abs:\"Code Generation\" OR abs:\"Few-shot Learning\" OR abs:\"Prompt Engineering\"\\'\\nstart_date = (datetime.date.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=7)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\\n\\n# Search arXiv for papers\\nsearch = arxiv.Search(\\n  query = search_query,\\n  max_results = 100,\\n  sort_by = arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate,\\n  sort_order = arxiv.SortOrder.Descending,\\n  date_from = start_date\\n)\\n\\n# Create a list to store paper information\\npapers = []\\n\\n# Iterate over search results and extract relevant information\\nfor result in search.results():\\n  try:\\n    papers.append({\\n        \\'title\\': result.title,\\n        \\'authors\\': \\', \\'.join([author.name for author in result.authors]),\\n        \\'date\\': result.published.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\"),\\n        \\'link\\': result.pdf_url,\\n        \\'abstract\\': result.summary\\n    })\\n  except Exception as e:\\n    print(f\"Error processing paper: {e}\")\\n\\n# Create a pandas DataFrame from the list of papers\\ndf = pd.DataFrame(papers)\\n\\n# Define the domain taxonomy\\ndomain_taxonomy = {\\n    \\'Natural Language Processing\\': [\\'Natural Language Processing\\', \\'NLP\\', \\'Text Generation\\', \\'Machine Translation\\', \\'Question Answering\\', \\'Sentiment Analysis\\', \\'Summarization\\'],\\n    \\'Computer Vision\\': [\\'Computer Vision\\', \\'Image Recognition\\', \\'Object Detection\\', \\'Image Captioning\\'],\\n    \\'Robotics\\': [\\'Robotics\\', \\'Robot Control\\', \\'Path Planning\\', \\'Computer Vision\\'],\\n    \\'Healthcare\\': [\\'Healthcare\\', \\'Medical Imaging\\', \\'Drug Discovery\\', \\'Disease Prediction\\'],\\n    \\'Code Generation\\': [\\'Code Generation\\', \\'Software Engineering\\', \\'Program Synthesis\\'],\\n    # Add more domains and keywords as needed\\n}\\n\\n# Function to categorize papers based on domain taxonomy\\ndef categorize_paper(abstract):\\n  domains = []\\n  for domain, keywords in domain_taxonomy.items():\\n    for keyword in keywords:\\n      if keyword.lower() in abstract.lower():\\n        domains.append(domain)\\n        break  # Move to the next domain once a keyword is found\\n  return domains\\n\\n# Apply the categorization function to the DataFrame\\ndf[\\'domains\\'] = df[\\'abstract\\'].apply(categorize_paper)\\n\\n# Generate the markdown table\\nmarkdown_table = df[[\\'domains\\', \\'title\\', \\'authors\\', \\'date\\', \\'link\\']].to_markdown(index=False)\\n\\n# Print the markdown table\\nprint(markdown_table)\\n```', 'name': 'Engineer', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 1 (execution failed)\\nCode output: \\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"\", line 2, in <module>\\n    import arxiv\\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named \\'arxiv\\'\\n', 'name': 'Executor', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant'}], summary='', cost={'usage_including_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0}, 'usage_excluding_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0}}, human_input=['', '', '', '', 'exit'])"
